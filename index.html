 <p>Today at 1pm, Retro got really frustrated because nobody is available with company to him, all he does because he thinks someone stole my relationship, however he does not until he will wait for few weeks/months. He needs to use climb up ladder skills until he got lucky. During his course Retro does not like to shout/interruptive/distruptive/etc because he donâ€™t wanna get lose his career.</p>

<body>
 <p>To make this cheer Retro up, all i can do is making/learning HTML coding so i can be web development course (as well as hardware/technican course) because Retro needs to achive for his goals (of course we have to payback at retarder in college)</p>
<body>

<body>
  <p>After all, i hope Retro gets certificates/grade paper when he's done all of his ICT course. he will move onto coding course or technican course</p>

  <p>Please see below, you can payback for this retarded</p>
