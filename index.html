<h1>Retro's index.html Page!</h1>
<p>I'm starter of HTML coder but still i'm big fan of interest in hardware/software.</p>
<p>Some things which i play with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Krunker.io</li>
    <li>Flash games (a bit for a moment which i remember)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course some games which i don't used often like Roblox/Minecraft but playing games are bit much often, not really much.</p>
